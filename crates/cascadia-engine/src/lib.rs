//! Engine + Builder trait definitions.
//!
//! Mirrors `cascadia/worker/engines/base.py`. Two narrow concerns:
//!
//! * [`Builder`] — configure listening, connect to peers, load the shard,
//!   then construct the [`Engine`].
//! * [`Engine`] — submit tasks; poll [`Engine::step`] for emitted chunks.
//!
//! `Engine::step` is intentionally synchronous — engines run an inference
//! request through to completion in a single call (matching the Python
//! semantics today). The async surface lives in [`Builder`] for I/O during
//! load and connect.
